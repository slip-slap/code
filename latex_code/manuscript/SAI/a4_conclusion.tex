\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, SAGA is proposed to search the optimal lay-up for laminated composite under different
loading. Two situations are considered under the same loading, a set of two distinct angles, and
three distinct angles, SAGA can adjust its convergence speed depending on the difference of
individual's constraint value and constraint threshold.
