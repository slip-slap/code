\section{Introduction}
Artificial neural works which heavily inspired by biology and psychology have been widely used to solve
various practical engineering problems in such areas as pattern recognition, nonlinear regression,
data mining, clustering and prediction.  The design of neural network consists of three basic parts,
neural network architecture, learning rules, and training techniques.
